        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            International orders are not accepted at the moment, as we only ship
            to the US. Also, non-contiguous US regions are <br />
            undeliverable.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use UPS for the courier service and the delivery time varies by
            location.
          </li>
          <li>
            It usually takes about 6-7 business days on average, but duly note
            that there may be delays for unforeseen factors that occur during
            <br />
            the shipment process.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p class="p-size"><strong>SHIPPING COST </strong></p>
        <br />
        <p class="p-size">
          For US residents, a flat rate of $6.99 will be charged for shipping.
          However, please be noted that it may vary depending on the <br />
          region, such as Hawaii or Alaska.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="p-size">Free shipping is offered for any orders above $60.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="p-size">
          <strong>RECIPIENT'S ABSENCE/UNCLEAR ADDRESS </strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="p-size">
          Please provide a physical address, as UPS does not ship to PO Box,
          FPO/DPO/APO addresses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="p-size">
          From time to time, a missed delivery or failed delivery attempt does
          happen due to your absence at the time of delivery or an <br />
          incomplete/unclear address.
          <br />
          In this case, the package will be returned to us, and you will receive
          a refund payment with the return fee deducted.
        </p>
